express → handles HTTP requests

mongoose → connects Node.js to MongoDB

dotenv → reads .env

cors → allows your frontend (Angular) to call backend

nodemon → restarts server automatically when code changes

client = Angular = ng serve
server = npm run dev

Node.js: the environment that runs JavaScript on the server. It executes your backend code.

Express: a lightweight web server framework for Node. It handles routes, HTTP methods, and requests/responses.

MongoDB: a NoSQL database that stores JSON-like documents. Flexible schema, good for quick apps.

Mongoose: a Node library that makes talking to MongoDB easier. It provides schemas, validation, and convenient methods.

Angular: frontend framework that builds the UI, handles components, forms, HTTP requests, and routing.

MongoDB Atlas: cloud-hosted MongoDB. No need to run DB on your machine.

Nodemon: dev tool that restarts the server when you change code.

Git/GitHub: version control and remote hosting for your code.
